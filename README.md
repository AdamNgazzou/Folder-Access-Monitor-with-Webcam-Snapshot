# Folder Access Monitor with Webcam Snapshot

This repository contains a Python script that monitors a specified folder for access. When the folder is accessed, the script automatically takes a snapshot using the connected webcam and saves the image to a predefined folder.

## Features

- Monitors a folder for any access (file modifications or opening).
- Takes a snapshot using the webcam when the folder is accessed.
- Saves the photo with a timestamp in a specific directory.
- The script can be set to run automatically when the system starts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- OpenCV library installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
The script has been set up to run automatically on Windows startup (see instructions below).

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/folder-access-monitor.git
2. Set Up the Folder to Monitor
The folder to monitor is defined in the script. By default, it monitors the folder ~/Desktop/exercises. You can change the value of FOLDER_TO_WATCH in the script to any folder path you'd like to monitor.

python
Copy
Edit
FOLDER_TO_WATCH = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/exercises")
3. Set Up the Photo Save Folder
The photos taken by the webcam are saved to a folder ~/Desktop/camerapassword/captured_images by default. You can change this path in the script as well:

python
Copy
Edit
PHOTO_SAVE_FOLDER = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/camerapassword/captured_images")
4. Running the Script Manually
To run the script manually, use the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python folder_access_monitor.py
5. Automatically Running the Script at Startup
To make the script run automatically when your computer starts, you can create a .bat file to execute the Python script on startup.

Open Notepad and create a new .bat file with the following content:

batch
Copy
Edit
@echo off
cd C:\path\to\your\repository
python folder_access_monitor.py
Save the .bat file to the following location in your system:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\run_camera_python_script.bat
This will ensure that the script runs automatically every time your computer starts.

How It Works
The script continuously checks the last access time of the monitored folder.

If the folder is accessed, the script will take a snapshot using the webcam and save it with a timestamped filename.

The snapshot is stored in the folder defined by PHOTO_SAVE_FOLDER.

Stopping the Script
To stop the script from running, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal window where the script is running.

Notes
Ensure that the folder you're monitoring is accessible and that you have the required permissions to read from it.

The webcam used to take snapshots should be connected and working properly.

If you encounter any errors with OpenCV, ensure that your Python environment is correctly configured.
